Reliable PSCs without observable downstream effects
===================================================

This folder contains Matlab code related to Tripp BP & Eliasmith C,
2006, Neural populations can induce reliable post-synaptic currents
without observable spike rate changes or precise spike timing.

The code is organized into the following sub-folders:

- `exp`: scripts for running numerical experiments
- `fig`: scripts for producing article figures
- `lib`: library functions that are called by the above scripts

Note that some of the figure scripts require data files that are
produced by the experiment scripts.

This code has been tested with Matlab 6.5 and Matlab 7.0.1.
